# This is a collection of useful notebooks for data science and machine learning.

Here I as a self taught devloper will be sharing my journey to learn AI and Machine Learning.
I will be documenting all of the things I learn and the projects i work on in form of different notebooks.

# The notebooks are organized into different folders based on the topics.
# The folders are as follows:

- **data/**: This folder contains the data used in the notebooks.
- **requirements.txt**: This file contains the list of required packages to run the notebooks (outside of the virtual environment).
- And all of the notebooks are in the root directory.
